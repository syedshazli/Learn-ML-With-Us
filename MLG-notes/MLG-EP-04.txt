***Abdu notes***:

Algorithm plus the pattern it learns is the model 

Features are pieces of the house that contribute to prediction (# of houses, distance to Quentin,etc)

Features are most important t part, algorithm looks at row, and learns coefficient to multiply

Features are variables x,y,z

Combination of rows and columns is matrix

1. Infer/predict
2. Error/loss function 
3. Train/learn 

Last column is the actual value, ML model adjusts coefficient based on prediction accordingly 

Retrain model is online learning 

Supervised learning, training on data: linear and logistic regression 
Ex: price of house, cat or dog

Unsupervised learning, machine clusters into a bin, ml algo funds what is in common

Reinforcement learning: taking steps, give it a goal: system of reward and punishment 
ML also figures out on its own the rules, actions, and brst strategy to achieve goal. It trains itself and is action oriented 

***Hasan Notes***:
 ---- ML broken down into 3 steps ---- 
Infer or predict Error or loss Train or learn Process of ML from price of house example {who,what, when, where , why , how}? 
Use a spreadsheet, upload to algorithms ( ex. linear regression) algorithm trains its model until it gets a sense to determine house price 
With that trained model, predict price of other houses 
  New examples train the algorithm ----> retraining model (online learning)

Algorithm is a piece of software written in a language (python, TensorFlow)
The algorithm runs over the rows of data in a spreadsheet and saves it 
The algorithm plus the pattern it has learned is the model 
Spreadsheet are rows (instances) and columns (features) 

Features can be alot of different things, numbers, true /false, yes/no
  - does ML always require spreadsheets? 
    Abdu thoughts: I would say yes because Machine Learning works on data and data sets. The machine won't know the right or wrong answer without being fed data

The algorithm determines what coefficient to put into what feature ---> learns what number to multiply the features also known as a weight

Features are the x,y,z (lin alg) takes bunch of equations and stack them together and solve for all of them 

Rows and columns are the matrix, averages them all and makes a prediction
Last column equals the actual price ML takes it row by row and make a prediction, show error (vector), then update (training) 

Supervised learning is trained on data, from a person (ex. linear/logistic regression) 
Unsupervised learning is the machine takes examples and throw it away (tossing) 

ML algorithm finds commonality and makes categories 

Reinforcement learning is taking actions, with system of reward and punishment 
given a goal, ML figures out the rules and which actions to take then best strategy to achieve goal 

It looks for the best course of action (the floor is lava method) - I would like to visually see these spreadsheets and rows and features -
Abdu- I agree, would like to see these spreadsheets carried out.

Mahveen Notes:
ML is broken intro 3 steps
1. infer/predict
2. error/loss function
3. train/learn

- In machine learning there are many algorithms designated to specific tasks (ie linear regression)
- Algorithm is piece of software written in python and tensorflow
- Algorithm trains its model until it has enough knowledge to make predictions
- New data would re-train which is called online training

- A model is the algorithm + pattern which its learned
- Model has rows and columns called features (ie rows are houses and columns are features)
- Spreadsheet is called a matrix
* interestingly topics i learned and worked with within my business analytics class

Three categories of algorithms 
1. Supervised learning 
   - train with bunch of information and data ie. linear regression
2. Unsupervised learning
   - ie. cluster analysis
3. Reinforcement learning 
   - give it a goal, give reinforcement â†’ will figure out the rules of the game, what actions it should take, and the best strategy to achieve its goal

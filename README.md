# Machine Learning 
Notes on anything Machine Learning that I find on my journey to discover the space. I will be working with 3 other people to discover the depth of ML and AI. We will start with the Machine Learning Guide podcast, and move into ML courses by Stanford and Google. This repo will have notes and implementations in Python from all 4 of us.

# MLG Episode 1:
Notes on episode 1 of the Machine Learning Guide podcast:
Syed thoughts:
Good first epidose that gives the structure. 
We discussed whether it's better to learn the math first or learn the math along the way. 
We finalized that it's better to learn the math along the way

Hasan thoughts:
MLG 1 Tells listener about the layout of the MLG course discusses prerequisites such as programming languages and maths (calc, discrete math) for ML Using supplementary resources from OCDevel for further understanding 

Mahveen thoughts:

Notes on Episode 2 of the Machine Learning Guide Podcast
Abdu notes: 
 -Whete can AI help us and hurt us as humans? 
- I wonder if it would be beneficial to get into neural networks, or if we should stay with basic models like Linear Regression 
- ML Prefers row structured data while Data analytics prefers column structured data. 
I think data analytics is interesting but we should focus on one thing at a time in order to not make the structure of the DB complicated.
I also don’t think we will be diving into business intelligence either -Data seems to be the driving factor of machine learning and is the input in ML models. 
- Where will we be getting our data from, and will we have to clean it? 
-thoughts on potentially making our own ML model instead of using existing ones?
-unlike bigger companies, when we learn I don’t think we should specificalize in specific roles so that we can learn the breadth of the process 
- I’ve used Bayes theory in probability. I’m interested in seeing how we use his findings in ML 
- ⁠I can now understand the difference between AI and ML 
- ⁠it seems we are in another AI boom. I don’t think this time we’ll under deliver due to much stronger computing power and big data

Hasan Notes:
MLG 2: DS is an encompassing term which includes AI ---> ML -------- ML/AI and Subdivs -------- 
AI is the theory of development of computer systems that perform tasks that usually require humans
These tasks include visual perception, speech recognition, decision making and translation AI revolution ------> revolutionizing the brain
People have subjective views of AI 
AI’s subfields are , reasoning and problem solving, knowledge/representation, planning, learning, natural language processing (NLP), motion and manipulation, social intelligence and general intelligence.
NLP -----> dedicated to language processing (chatbots/S to T/entity recognition etc.)
Question answering ---> extractiveley, abstractively Knowledge representation -----> deep blue could play jeopardy using NLP and representation 
Reasoning and problem solving ----> probabilistic Planning ----> taking actions in an environment (beat Gary Kaspov in Chess/ videogames to self driving car)
Perception ----> senses by sensors Motion and manipulation ----> performing action when stimulated by perception (actuators) Social intelligence -----> AI tuned into human emotions (sentiment analysis, face recog) 

AGI -----> goal of creating an AI that is generalizable, combining all subdivisions of AI (weak can only handle one domain)
 - I think that a close current example of this is ChatGPT 
- How do we define artificial intelligence (subjective matter) ? Hand written scripts are on the left, AGI is all the way on the right, in the middle is what we are trying to define


-------- ML --------
- The Turing test says, if youre chatting with an artificial agent, is either a human or an AI and you cant tell if its human, or AI, then it is intelligent. 
 If an AI can convince you its not an AI, its intelligent [Hardscripting ----- AGI], the point where we define intelligence is where we cant deny it
ML, the last subdiv Machine learning is learning on data to make predictions, pattern recognition over data t make future prediction Feed it a spreadsheet, predict tommorows spreadsheet, trying to find patterns in the spreadsheet
When those learned patterns are saved, they are combined into an algorithm Or model, which is a combination of the algorithm (programmed) and the patterns learned (learned)
- NLP was language theory, Machine learning destroyed these scripts of NLP with transformers models (generally applicable) and neural networks HOGG, HARR, computer visions, which were dominated by ML’s convolutional neural networks (CNN) 
CNN learned these patterns and knocked these HOGG and HARR scripts out of the park DRML dominated subdivs like perception, planning and reasoning DRML’s not only knew how to play a game, but it aslo learned how to play in general ML is more effective than scripts, and more generalizable 
  - I understand what ML is, and how it’s different from AI


-------- DS (data science) -------- 

Data science is the umbrella term that encompasses anything with data Data pipeline [ Gets data --------> data analytics, business intelligence, ML] 
Data ingestion is to get data from somewhere [(spreadsheet,DB [SQL], no SQL (mongoDB), stream of data (processed, throw away) 
 example is twitter, data set, data store, stream/firehose)]
Data lake is the aggregation of various data sets into one repository/umbrella 
DLT’s allow you to apply features like permissions and unifying schemas into data Feature store (by Feature engineering) is cleaned up data that is stored using imputation, data conversion (transfromation) , keeping and discarding features

- what are common examples of the data pipeline? 
  - I can explain the data pipeline Data analytics, first step is to store data in a data warehouse A data warehouse takes a slice of historical data and transform it to be in column format A sort of proxy between the data lake and and the analyst (fast querying) 

- Machine learning makes automated decisions, DS causes human decision making Data driven decision 
 making data driven decisions is taking data and analyzing it to make a decision

ML is automated predictions made by models (TensorFlow, Pychart etc.) or taking action (buy,tweet) 

- Rest of the episode talks about the history of AI,
   very interesting Thomas Baye’s reasoning and probability of events and how Baysian inference is fundamental to ML Neurons ----> perception ----> neural network

# MLG Episode 3:
Abdu notes:
innovation has always served to help man and 
make their lives easier, but when is it a problem for
making our lives too easy?


Hasan notes:
MLG 3 - this episode talks about innovation and how AI is changing the world
---- 4 philosophical talks about AI ----- 
-Automation of the economy (medical, web design, cars, taxes etc.) 
  *Creativity is not exempt from AI Fear ( ex. losing jobs) and excitement ( ex. self driving cars) both come out of the AI revolution 

-The singularity term which means the point of no return

-The notion of AGI is making our lives better is good, but making another AGI with a previous AGI (seed AI) is better because it evolves, but it reaches a singularity 

-Conciousness might be “the last bastion of unsolved life riddles” - is the mind a machine? 

-An AI is intelligence if it’s effective

-Dualism is the soul is different from the brain

# MLG Episode 4:
***Abdu notes***:

Algorithm plus the pattern it learns is the model 

Features are pieces of the house that contribute to prediction (# of houses, distance to Quentin,etc)

Features are most important t part, algorithm looks at row, and learns coefficient to multiply

Features are variables x,y,z

Combination of rows and columns is matrix

1. Infer/predict
2. Error/loss function 
3. Train/learn 

Last column is the actual value, ML model adjusts coefficient based on prediction accordingly 

Retrain model is online learning 

Supervised learning, training on data: linear and logistic regression 
Ex: price of house, cat or dog

Unsupervised learning, machine clusters into a bin, ml algo funds what is in common

Reinforcement learning: taking steps, give it a goal: system of reward and punishment 
ML also figures out on its own the rules, actions, and brst strategy to achieve goal. It trains itself and is action oriented 

***Hasan Notes***:
 ---- ML broken down into 3 steps ---- 
Infer or predict Error or loss Train or learn Process of ML from price of house example {who,what, when, where , why , how}? 
Use a spreadsheet, upload to algorithms ( ex. linear regression) algorithm trains its model until it gets a sense to determine house price 
With that trained model, predict price of other houses 
  New examples train the algorithm ----> retraining model (online learning)

Algorithm is a piece of software written in a language (python, TensorFlow)
The algorithm runs over the rows of data in a spreadsheet and saves it 
The algorithm plus the pattern it has learned is the model 
Spreadsheet are rows (instances) and columns (features) 

Features can be alot of different things, numbers, true /false, yes/no
  - does ML always require spreadsheets? 
    Abdu thoughts: I would say yes because Machine Learning works on data and data sets. The machine won't know the right or wrong answer without being fed data

The algorithm determines what coefficient to put into what feature ---> learns what number to multiply the features also known as a weight

Features are the x,y,z (lin alg) takes bunch of equations and stack them together and solve for all of them 

Rows and columns are the matrix, averages them all and makes a prediction
Last column equals the actual price ML takes it row by row and make a prediction, show error (vector), then update (training) 

Supervised learning is trained on data, from a person (ex. linear/logistic regression) 
Unsupervised learning is the machine takes examples and throw it away (tossing) 

ML algorithm finds commonality and makes categories 

Reinforcement learning is taking actions, with system of reward and punishment 
given a goal, ML figures out the rules and which actions to take then best strategy to achieve goal 

It looks for the best course of action (the floor is lava method) - I would like to visually see these spreadsheets and rows and features -
Abdu- I agree, would like to see these spreadsheets carried out.
